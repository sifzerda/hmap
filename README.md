# Description ðŸ’€

This is a smaller companion blog to Fiction Map. It provides an in depth guide on horror fiction and narrative writing. It's more concerned with how to write a scary story, and exploring what makes a story scary. 

The site runs front-end in React, on an Express server, with Node.js. There are a handful of pages each covering a separate topic on horror writing, including techniques, scary scenes, genre, scary sentences, etc. The back-end has a Mongodb database, and graphql queries, and enables user registration for basic account access, user authentication by JWT. Users can leave comments on each page, and contact me via a working contact form on the contact page (to do).

This is a personal project that happened alongside building the fiction map page. Many techniques I collected referred specifically to horror atmosphere writing and couldn't be included on the fic-map page, which required a separate website.

## 5. Usage ðŸ‘»

User authentication with JWTs allow users to create an account, which stores data on past store and ticket purchases. Users can also leave reviews to shows they've seen. Visitors can browse current shows and make a purchase of a ticket to a show. Payment for tickets uses PayPal, while merchandise store purchases use Stripe. 

Once purchasing a ticket or merchandise, users can find records of purchases displaying on their profile page.
